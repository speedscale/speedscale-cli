# speedscale CLI

`speedscale` is a container-centric, capture and replay CLI tool created by [Speedscale](https://speedscale.com).
`speedscale` wraps your running application, capturing all inbound and outbound traffic while in use.  Catputed traffic
is inspected to show data going to and from your application, with higher level details for various protocols.
